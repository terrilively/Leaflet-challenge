Hi!  This repository is for homework assignment 17.  For this assignment I have visualized earthquakes occuring globally using a live API feed provided by the USGA (United States Geological Survey).  The data feed is updated every 5 minutes and it includes earthquake data for the past 7 days.  Also included is a layer of tectonic plates to understand the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activites.

The web application is deployed at the following link:
   * https://github.com/terrilively/Leaflet-challenge

   Technology Stack Used to develop this application:
   *  HTML/CSS/Bootstrap/JavaScript/
   *  GeoJSON
   *  leaflet.js

   Data Sources Used:
      * https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson/php
      * https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates


Thanks for stopping by!
